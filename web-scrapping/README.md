# Web Scrapers
A few scrapers which can be use to extract the desired information from a website.

## __Movie Scraper__ 
The `Movie_scraper.py` allows users to information of a movie such as the actor/actress, their profile page and the other movies they are involved in from imdb website. 

## __Zoopla Property Scraper__ 
The `zoopla_property_scraper.py` scrapes the desired property information from 
[Zoopla's website](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/). It will scrape the property's name, value, location and the agent that is responsible for it. 

## __Selenium Practicals__ 
The `selenium_practicals.py` is similar to `zoopla_property_scraper.py`. The difference between the two scraper is that `selenium_practicals.py` uses Selenium and chromdriver to interact with the web browser to scrape information from the website. The scraper will search for property on [Zoopla's website](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/) based on user's input.
